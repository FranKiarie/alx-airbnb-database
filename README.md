# 🏡 ALX Airbnb Database Project

This project is part of the **ALX Database Module** and implements a **relational database** for an Airbnb-like application.  
It demonstrates **professional database design**, normalization, schema creation, and realistic data seeding.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
The project simulates building a **production-grade database** that could support an online property rental platform like Airbnb.

## 🗂️ Features
- **Entity-Relationship Design (ERD):** based on users, properties, bookings, payments, reviews, and messages.  
- **Normalized Schema:** up to 3NF for efficiency and integrity.  
- **UUID Primary Keys:** scalable, globally unique identifiers.  
- **Constraints & Checks:** enforce valid roles, booking dates, payment methods, and rating ranges.  
- **Sample Seed Data:** hosts, guests, properties, bookings, and reviews.  
- **Continuous Integration (CI):** GitHub Actions automatically test schema and seed with PostgreSQL 14.
